This shows how to build a chat application with a ReactJS Frontend and a Firebase Backend. The chat application can record the time messages are sent between users and saves this data. I learnt how to implement a firebase authentication and storage system to ensure the registration/login and data was secured. The code should provide evidence of how this chat app works, if downloaded and tested it would require you to install an authentication system with Firebase.
